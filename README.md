### Hi there 👋

Hi, my name is Julian. I'm a father and a happy husband of a beautiful wife. I live in Stuttgart, Germany. I'm working as a software engineer at [exxeta AG](https://exxeta.com/).

I have several interests. I love to code. I'm an eager learner, and now I'm starting to make my knowledge and learnings public. For this, I'm writing and speaking on conferences. I'm interested in cloud and web development, architecture, embedded systems and IoT/IIoT. Currently, I'm learning Rust 🦀 since I don't want to create my next Spring Boot application.

I'm also interested in sports. I'm a passionate skier 🎿. Haunting the powder in Europe. If there is no snow, I love to play the drums 🥁 in my stoner rock band and explore the streets on my road bike 🚴‍♂️.
